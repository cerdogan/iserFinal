2-	Perception:		Localize the small cinder block 
		+ requires instructing vision computer what program to run
		+ requires clustering the vision data
		- requires a scene file that contains all the objects
		- requires combining the current robot pose with the vision data

3-	Locomotion:		Approach more
4-	Perception:		Localize the small cinder block 
5-	Manipulation:	Pick up the small cinder block with the preconfigured grasp 
	 	- requires jacobian

6-	Locomotion:		Bring the small cinder block to the default location
7-	Perception:		Localize the obstacle and determine goal pose 
8-	Locomotion:		Approach more
9-	Perception:		Localize the obstacle and determine goal pose again to refine
10-	Manipulation:	Perform RRTs and place the small cinder block 

PART B:
1-	Locomotion: 	Go towards the large cinder block to pick up with right arm
2-	Perception:		Localize the large cinder block 
3-	Locomotion:		Approach more
4-	Manipulation:	Pick up the large cinder block with the preconfigured grasp
5-	Locomotion:		Bring the large cinder block to the default location
6-	Perception:		Localize the small cinder block and determine goal pose 
7-	Manipulation:	Perform RRTs and place the large cinder block 

PART C:

5-	Locomotion:		Bring the plate to the default location
6-	Perception: 	Localize the second (top) cinder block
7-	Planning: 		Fix the two cinder blocks and ensure there is a plate pose
8-	Manipulation:	Perform RRTs and place the plate 

PART D:
1-	Locomotion: 	Go towards the first plate to pick up with both arms 
2-	Perception:		Localize the plate
