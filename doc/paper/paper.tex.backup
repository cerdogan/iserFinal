\begin{abstract}

For robots to become integral parts of human daily experi- ence, they need to be able to utilize the
objects in their environment to accomplish any range of tasks. In this work, we focus particularly
on physically challenging tasks that push the limits on the robot kinodynamic constraints such as
joint limits, joint torques and etc. Previously, we demonstrated an autonomous planner that
instructs a human collab- orator where to place the available objects in the environment to form a
simple machine such as a lever-fulcrum assembly. In this work, we report results on the autonomous
realization of such a design by the humanoid robot Golem Krang, focusing on the challenges of
autonomous perception, manipulation and control.

\section{Introduction}

The ability to use the available objects in the environment towards accomplishing goals is essential
to thriving in challenging circumstances. Everyday examples of tool use include simple machines such
as levers and pulleys. The challenge in autonomous design of such simple machines is the space of
discrete choices for the component options and the related high-dimensional continuous configuration
space of the chosen components.

In previous work \cite{erdogan2013planning} \cite{erdogan2014incorporating}, we demonstrated the
constraint satisfaction approach to assembly design, specifically for robotic manipulation and
locomotion. The key idea is to represent the constraints
between the components of the design, the robot kinematics and dynamics as generic equality and
inequality functions within a nonlinear optimization framework and solve for the global minima, if
necessary by random restarts. Such global optimization methods have been used in other fields as
well, such as operations research \cite{vidal2006branching} and architecture \cite{yu2011make}.

In this work, we take the next step towards full autonomy where the humanoid robot, Golem Krang,
autonomously manipulates the objects in its environment to construct a simple machine. We present
an autonomous planner that perceives the available objects, specifically 15 kg cinder blocks and 10
kg 2-by-4 block blocks (e.g. potential levers), relocates them to the desired configurations output
by the constraint planner, and actuates them to flip a 45 kg load. Figure \ref{fig:showOff} demonstrates key scenes
from this scenario such as (a) detection of a cinder block, (b) locomotion with a heavy load, (c)
manipulating a lever while subject to multiple constraints and (d) application of force to the lever
leading to a successful load motion.

Significant effort has been demonstrated by \cite{beetz2010cram} \cite{stilman2005navigation}
\cite{kemp2007challenges} to incorporate autonomous agents in human environments. Our work stands
out in multiple aspects from the established state of the art. First, Golem Krang is a two-wheeled
balancing robot, similar to a segway with two 7-dof robotic arms installed. The challenge with
such a platform is the dynamic stability constraint where the robot has to ensure its center of mass
is close to the wheel axis at all times as opposed to legged or multi-wheeled platforms. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge,
Golem Krang is the tallest and heaviest two-wheeled robot with 150 kg at 1.9 m, a unique property
among similar designs \cite{kuindersma2009dexterous}. As we expand in Section IV, at this scale, the
weight can help with heavy-duty manipulation but complicates the autonomous locomotion of the
agent. Lastly, Golem Krang perceives its environment with an onboard RGBD sensor with two degrees
of freedom that are manipulated autonomously for gaze control. Autonomous perception and scene
recognition has only recently started to gather interest in the humanoid robotics field
\cite{srinivasa2010herb} \cite{nishiwaki2000design} as opposed to the long established motion
capture methods \cite{dasgupta1999making}.

\section{Constraint Satisfaction for Simple Machine Designs}

The manipulation of multiple objects to achieve a goal can be readily represented in a constraint
satisfaction paradigm where the constraints represent the relationships between the design
components. In this work, we focus on simple machine designs such as lever-fulcrum assemblies or
inclined planes that need to be structurally stable and provide mechanical leverage to their users.
Reasoning about such design criteria requires analysis of more detailed concepts such as center
of masses, robot kinodynamic constraints and physics principles. 

The process for an autonomous planner is composed of three steps. First, from the set of available objects
in the environment, it needs to choose a subset that will be incorporated in the structure. Second,
the structure components are assigned roles that designate how they should be put together - specifically,
the constraints that \textit{bind} one to another. Lastly, the planner needs to configure the objects
such that the role constraints and the general design criteria are satisfied. 

\subsection{Component Choices}

A completeness property for an autonomous planner for structural designs is a crucial advantage
for deployment in real-world circumstances (e.g. military or search-and-rescue operations). In
emergency situations, when physically challenging that requires creative reasoning about simple
machines usually arise, the ability to exhaustively search for all possible solutions and determine
if one exists is a critical advantage. Note that we assume every object is used only once in the 
structure as opposed to the agent changing the structure as its being used.

In choosing a set of design components, an autonomous planner needs to exhaustively search the 
entire \textit{finite} space of discrete assignments. In comparison to continuous choices, such as
object configurations, the discrete nature of the choices (i.e. in or out) makes such a search
feasible. Despite the finite space, it is challenging to evaluate
every alternative since there is still a combinational number of roles and infinite 
space of configurations to reason about.

To remedy the computational challenge, pruning strategies and heuristics are significant tools in
cutting back the search at the top level. For instance, in construction a lever-fulcrum design,
two wooden blocks of the same size (or approximately to a degree of confidence) can be categorized
under one class. Similarly, for loads that are known to be significantly heavier than a robot can
handle, the longer lever candidates might be priotized in the search process.

\subsection{Object Roles} 

Imagine a two-step stairs is needed to enable a swarm of rough-terrain vehicles, such as 
PackBots or RHexs \cite{yamauchi2004packbot,saranli2001rhex}, climb a window and survey a building, and some of them have robotic
arms that can stack box-like objects. The goal for a planner would be to choose three boxes and
stack two of them (e.g. box B on C) such that the swarm can first climb one step and then move on to
the two stack, until it reaches the window sill. 

In coming up with this solution, two types of choices need to made. First, among the three objects,
say A, B, and C, which object would constitute as the first step and which one would be at the top
in the second step needs to be decided. Secondly, to place the objects on the ground or on top of
another object, a base face needs to be chosen to clarify the object roles and to simplify the
representation of the constraints for the object configurations. Note that choosing a base 
in fact partitions the configuration space of the objects even before the design constraints
are considered to prune infeasible assignments.

The role assignment to available resources has been a thoroughly studied area, starting from
classical planning \cite{newell1961gps}, and evolving into operations research \cite{fulkerson1961network, taha1975integer}, 
and in this work, we adopt the STRIPS representation for the planning process.
